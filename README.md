This app will show you the country you typed in input or country where you are located (for this you need to give permission to locate you) and all countries-neighbours of one.
It is doesn't matter which language you are typing, english or russian, it will show you all possible countries.
BUT, because of lack of some countries or not universal data storage of restcountries.com API, some countries will not be available. For example, in connection to data storage, if you'll type United States there will be only one option and it is not USA, but United States Minor Outlying Islands. Or Georgia - not Georgia in Europe but South Georgia in Antarctic.

Stack:
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

- **APIs**: reverse geolocation - geoapify.com; countries info - restcountries.com
- **Fetch functions** to get data from API's; also there is **Async/await** (it commented in code. In case you want to check you can comment the fetch block and uncomment async/await)
- **Promisification**
- Also I made a **dropdown list from typed letters in input** first time.
- **Language identification** using JavaScript
